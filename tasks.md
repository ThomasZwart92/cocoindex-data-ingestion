# Task Tracker - Data Ingestion Portal

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL ISSUES - FIX IMMEDIATELY (Data Integrity at Risk)

### Database Transaction Management
- [ ] **Implement explicit transaction boundaries** - Currently using autocommit=False but no commit/rollback calls
  - [ ] Wrap all multi-step database operations in try/except/finally blocks
  - [ ] Add db.session.commit() on success
  - [ ] Add db.session.rollback() on failure
  - [ ] Priority files: app/api/documents.py, app/api/chunks.py, app/api/entities.py
- [ ] **Add connection pooling** - Currently creating new connections for each request
  - [ ] Configure SQLAlchemy connection pool in app/services/database.py
  - [ ] Set pool_size and max_overflow parameters

### External API Resilience  
- [ ] **Apply retry logic to ALL external services** - Only LLM service has retry
  - [ ] Copy retry decorator from app/services/llm_service.py
  - [ ] Apply to app/connectors/notion_connector.py
  - [ ] Apply to app/connectors/google_drive_connector.py
  - [ ] Apply to app/services/embedding_service.py
- [ ] **Add client-side rate limiting** - Risk of API ban from Notion/Google
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting for Notion API calls
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting for Google Drive API calls

## ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY - Fix Before Production

### Error Handling & Observability
- [ ] **Replace generic exception handling** - Currently catching Exception everywhere
  - [ ] Replace with specific exceptions (SQLAlchemyError, RequestException, etc.)
  - [ ] Add proper logging before re-raising
  - [ ] Don't expose internal errors to users
- [ ] **Add React Error Boundaries** - Frontend crashes on errors
  - [ ] Add top-level error boundary in frontend/app/layout.tsx
  - [ ] Add error boundaries around major components
- [ ] **Add loading states** - No feedback during async operations
  - [ ] Add loading spinners for all API calls
  - [ ] Add skeleton loaders for data fetching

### Input Validation & Security
- [ ] **Add input validation** - User input goes directly to database
  - [ ] Use Pydantic models for all API endpoints
  - [ ] Validate all query parameters
  - [ ] Sanitize JSON inputs
- [ ] **Remove fake auth code** - Misleading security theater
  - [ ] Replace app/services/auth_service.py with NotImplementedError
  - [ ] Remove token logic from frontend until real auth is ready
  - [ ] Add clear TODO comments about auth being deferred

## ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Tasks (High Value)
