# Out of Scope (OOS) - Not Important for MVP/PoC

This document lists features and concerns that are **NOT** critical for proving the concept works. These can be addressed after we have a working system.

## 🔒 Security & Authentication
**Status**: COMPLETELY OUT OF SCOPE for PoC

- API key authentication
- JWT tokens
- Row-level security (RLS)
- User sessions
- Permission systems
- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- SQL injection prevention (using ORM handles this)
- Input validation beyond basic type checking

**Why defer**: We're building an internal tool. Security can be added as a layer once the core functionality works.

## 📊 Performance Optimization
**Status**: OUT OF SCOPE until we have actual performance issues

- Database connection pooling
- Query optimization
- Caching layers (Redis for reads)
- Batch processing optimizations
- Streaming for large files
- Pagination for list operations
- Index optimization
- Lazy loading

**Why defer**: With <100 documents, performance is not a real concern. Optimize when needed.

## 🏗️ Architecture Consolidation
**Status**: OUT OF SCOPE - Current architecture works

- Consolidating to single PostgreSQL database
- Replacing Qdrant with pgvector
- Removing Neo4j in favor of recursive CTEs
- Simplifying to two-tier architecture

**Why defer**: The three-database architecture works. Yes, it's complex, but it's already built and functional.

## 🔄 Advanced State Management
**Status**: PARTIAL - Only basic states needed

- Complex state machines with 10+ states
- State transition validations
- Rollback mechanisms
- Audit logs for every state change
- State history tracking
- Concurrent state handling

**Why defer**: Basic states (processing, complete, failed) are enough for PoC.

## 📈 Monitoring & Observability
**Status**: OUT OF SCOPE

- Sentry error tracking
- Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- Prometheus metrics
- Grafana dashboards
- Log aggregation (ELK stack)
- Performance monitoring
- Cost tracking dashboards
- Alert systems

**Why defer**: Console logs are sufficient for development. Add monitoring when in production.

## 🧪 Comprehensive Testing
**Status**: MINIMAL - Only critical path testing

Out of scope:
- Unit tests for every function
- Integration tests for all combinations
- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Chaos engineering
- Security testing
- Accessibility testing
- Browser compatibility testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing

Keep only:
- Basic "does it process a document" test
- Basic "can I edit a chunk" test
- Basic "does search work" test

**Why defer**: Get it working first, then add tests.

## 🎨 UI Polish
**Status**: OUT OF SCOPE

- Beautiful CSS
- Animations
- Loading skeletons
- Toast notifications
- Drag and drop
- Dark mode
- Responsive design for mobile
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard nav)
- Internationalization (i18n)

**Why defer**: Functional UI is enough. Make it pretty later.

## 📦 Advanced Features
**Status**: OUT OF SCOPE

- Document versioning
- Change tracking/diff view
- Collaborative editing
- Real-time collaboration
- Export to various formats
- Import from various formats
- Webhook integrations
- API for external systems
- Plugin system
- Custom entity types
- Custom chunking strategies
- Multi-tenant support

**Why defer**: Core functionality first. These are "nice to have" features.

## 🔄 Sync Optimizations
**Status**: SIMPLIFIED - One-way sync only

Out of scope:
- Bi-directional sync
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Optimistic locking
- Pessimistic locking
- Event sourcing
- CQRS pattern
- Sync queues with priority
- Partial sync
- Incremental sync

Keep only:
- Simple "save edit to Supabase"
- Simple "regenerate embedding on approval"

**Why defer**: Complex sync can cause more bugs than it solves at this stage.

## 💰 Cost Management
**Status**: OUT OF SCOPE

- LlamaParse cost tracking
- OpenAI API cost monitoring
- Gemini API cost tracking
- Per-document cost calculation
- Budget alerts
- Cost optimization algorithms
- Tiered processing based on budget

**Why defer**: At <100 documents, costs are negligible. Track manually if needed.

## 🚀 Deployment Optimizations
**Status**: OUT OF SCOPE

- Docker optimization
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Auto-scaling
- Blue-green deployments
- Canary deployments
- CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- Multi-region deployment
- CDN for static assets
- Database replicas

**Why defer**: Local development or simple Railway deployment is sufficient.

## 📝 Documentation
**Status**: MINIMAL

Out of scope:
- Comprehensive API documentation
- OpenAPI/Swagger specs
- User guides
- Video tutorials
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Runbooks
- Troubleshooting guides
- Contributing guidelines

Keep only:
- Basic README
- Comments in complex code sections

**Why defer**: Documentation can be written once the system stabilizes.

## 🔧 Error Handling Sophistication
**Status**: BASIC ONLY

Out of scope:
- Circuit breakers
- Exponential backoff with jitter
- Dead letter queues
- Compensating transactions
- Saga pattern
- Graceful degradation
- Fallback strategies
- Error recovery workflows

Keep only:
- Try/catch with console.error
- Return error messages to user
- Mark document as "failed" if processing fails

**Why defer**: Simple error handling is enough to identify issues during development.

## 🌐 Browser Compatibility
**Status**: OUT OF SCOPE

- Internet Explorer support
- Safari quirks
- Mobile browser testing
- Progressive Web App (PWA)
- Offline support
- Service workers

**Why defer**: Develop in Chrome/Firefox. Fix compatibility issues if/when they arise.

## 📊 Analytics
**Status**: OUT OF SCOPE

- User behavior tracking
- Feature usage analytics
- Search query analytics
- Processing time analytics
- Error rate tracking
- Conversion funnels
- A/B testing framework

**Why defer**: Focus on making it work, not measuring how it works.

## What SHOULD We Focus On?

### Week 1: Core Functionality
1. ✅ Process a document through CocoIndex
2. ✅ Store data in Qdrant and Neo4j
3. ✅ Create API endpoints to fetch data
4. ✅ Basic frontend to display documents

### Week 2: Editing & Review
1. ✅ Display chunks in UI
2. ✅ Edit chunk text
3. ✅ Display entities
4. ✅ Basic approval button

### Week 3: Search
1. ✅ Vector search endpoint
2. ✅ Basic search UI
3. ✅ Display search results

## Remember

**MVP = Minimum VIABLE Product**

If it can:
1. Ingest a document
2. Show chunks and entities
3. Allow basic edits
4. Search for content

Then it's VIABLE. Everything else is optimization.

## The One Exception: Real-time Updates

Based on the review, SSE (Server-Sent Events) for real-time updates is worth implementing early because:
- Processing takes 30+ seconds
- Polling is terrible UX
- SSE is relatively simple to implement
- It dramatically improves the user experience

This is the ONE "nice to have" that should be treated as "must have".
